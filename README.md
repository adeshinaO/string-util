## string_util

A _Rusty_ library that provides a set of utility functions for various operations involving strings.

This was mostly a learning project and the feature set is very small. I don't plan to devote any serious amount of time to this project. 

## Usage

The library is a published Rust crate. See [crates.io/string_util](https://crates.io/crates/string_util) for dependency information. The docs are hosted at [docs.rs/string_util](https://docs.rs/string_util/0.1.0/string_util/)
